# Ulauncher Desktop Entries

This is a v5 extension that surfaces the entries in .desktop files in PATH.

The way it currently works is 
```
x <app_name> <desktop_action>
```

Currently, there are a few issues with the extension: 
- [ ] Surface Application's Icon
- [ ] Search all desktop entries without having to specify app

Please feel free to contribute!
